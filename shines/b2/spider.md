## Bianco 2 | Spider
We'll look at what we're aiming to do, what inputs we need to have down, and then go through a flowchart of reacting to the spider.

### Goals
* Jump off the spider close enough to the windmill to make it over there. This means in the back 3/4 or so on the pond (from the entry-point).
    * Dive onto the spider if possible (gives more speed on the jump).
    * Spin in midair if it looks like it might not make it (this decreases Mario's gravity in the *falling* half of the jump, so isn't that useful).
* The initial angle of the jump makes the biggest difference for speed and whether you'll make it, so we'll pay special attention to it. Loosely speaking, bear in mind the [imaginary line](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/817481323349671997/unknown.png) from the entry-point to the corner in the back wall, to orient yourself.
* The spider homes in on Mario whenever you land in the water, so we can use that to **bait** it if it's in a really bad location (it's a slow strategy).

That's all that we need to come up with a linear beginner strategy. Make sure to start practising the normal reaction-based strategy detailed below asap, though, since it's key to getting a good (first) windmill cycle.

<details markdown="block"><summary>Beginner Spider Notes</summary>
Spin-jump-dive off the shore after the waterslide to get close to the back wall, then try to immobilise the spider. You can wait for it to home in, then jump out and hover over it, or if it's in front of you, jump out and spam-spray while in the air. Try to then swim/hover around to get a good angle on it, then jump, hover (possibly backwards) to give yourself the right spacing, release hover and dive onto it.

### Inputs
There are a number of non-trivial inputs to practise that are used for different spiders.
* **Water jump-dive (WJD)**: *this is the fastest method for swimming in the game*. Mario can only jump out of the water when the left stick is neutral. As soon as you jump, hold forward and press B – sliding thumb from A to B in 1f is ideal. After landing, you can hit neutral again and repeat, but multiple swims are rarely needed in Bianco 2.
* **Water spam-spray (WSS)**: we can exploit the above mechanic to spam-spray without jumping out of the water – we just need to spam-spray while holding up. These are great for immobilising a spider that's coming towards you from in front.
* **Spam-spray dive (SSD)**: this is the same as the normal movement option for starting a waterslide from having the spray nozzle active (e.g. used in Ricco 5 and Gelato 1 to clear bloopers/cataquacks). Jump out of the water, hold digital R, then slide thumb from A to B.
* **Spam-spray hover (SSH)**: similarly to the above, jump out of the water, hold digital R, then slide thumb from A to X. The hover takes a few more frames to come out, so these inputs must be somewhat fast.

## Spider Flowchart
*Explained with a sample of 20 spider reactions from EquivocalGenius.*

At each jump, we'll react to where the spider is and pick a next move. At **step 1**, do **one or two jump-dive-rollouts along the shore**, to get closer to the spider without entering the water – one vs two depending on which brings you closest to it. This also buys us time to react to a spider that's not visible upon approaching the lake (since it's off to the left).

*Try to not enter the water by accident; if the spider is in the middle, baiting it brings it too close, so it'd have to be baited back, which would lose tons of time. You can grind along the wall while jumping/diving to take it safely, and won't bonk unless your angle is very aggressive.*

At **step 2**, we have three strategies, depending on where the spider is.

### Zone A: Rushdown
In this region, **spin-jump-dive straight towards the spider**. This is the fastest overall option.
* If the spider is really close to the windmill, bait it by landing from the rollout into the shallow water, then spin-jump-dive.
* If it's in a normal location within the zone, don't bait by jumping off the grass.

At **step 3**, we react to how far away the spider is from Mario's landing position.
* If the spider was baited, then it's coming at you; immobilise it with a **water spam-spray (WSS)**. <#12, #18>
* If the spider's at a medium distance, then approach + immobilse it with a **spam-spray dive (SSD)** – this move is slower but covers a large area with the spam-spray. <#1, #4, #11>
* If the spider's still far, then approach it with a **water jump-dive (WJD)**, baiting it in doing so, and immobilise with **WSS** upon landing. <#2>

To **finish**, you're close enough to the spider to jump and dive onto it. A short hover may be needed to adjust the angle, or distance if you fell short.

### Zone B: Containment
In this region, the spider is one of two things:
* too close to the left shore for a spin-jump-dive to approach it with space *(here, a spin-jump-dive may be unsafe since an accidental bait by rolling out into the water would pull it behind Mario)*;
* so far along the shore (2 jump-dive-rollouts) that it's about to skate off in a random direction as you approach it.

The move is to **spam-spray hover (SSH) straight from the shore** to immobilise the spider, then change direction midair to react to where it was starting to head to, and dive.

* In most cases with the spider far enough from the left shore, this move places Mario heading towards the spider with enough space to finish by jumping out, possibly hovering to adjust angle, then diving. <#3, #6, #13, #17, #19, #20>
* If the spider is too far away (it may not even have been immobilised by the spam-spray), landing baits it, and it can be finished in the manner of step 3 of rushdown, whereby you WSS, SSD, or jump-dive+WSS towards it depending on your distance from it after landing. <#8>
* *[advanced only]* If the spider is getting too close to the left shore – zone B/C – then it can take some fairly difficult improvisation to deal with it, in particular:
    * Diving straight onto the spider instead of into the water after the SSH. <#7, #14, #16>
    * Back-hovering and turning during the finishing move. <#5>

If you're not advanced (experienced with this level) and see a spider in the B/C zone after one jump-dive-rollout along the shore, do the bait strat (for zone C) instead.

### Zone C: Bait
In this region, we **give up on the spider's position and bait it into a good one**; this is very slow. In zone C, it's impossible to jump from the spider to the windmill, and in zone B/C, it's hard to adjust angle using the zone-B strat, so we opted for an easier option. After one jump-dive-rollout along the shore, at which point you've decided to bait the spider:
1. Spin-jump-dive directly towards the windmill (the bait starts upon landing).
2. WJD further towards the windmill.
3. Jump emptily out of the water while waiting for the spider to arrive.
4. Jump, hover backwards over the spider, and if you immobilise it, hover forward, adjust angle, and dive onto it.
