## Bianco 2 | Windmill
The windmill turns one full circle in 60.06s *(it would've been 60s if the game ran at 30fps instead of 29.97s)*, meaning its cycles repeat every 15s. We'll look at 3 setups for windmill wallkicks.

The first step in each setup is to ledgegrab the windmill's alcove. Where exactly depends on the setup, but the methods are the same. Here are two:
* **Wall-kick hover**: when landing from the hover to the windmill, buffer a spin-jump, and release it after taking a step towards the left edge of the alcove. Once airborne, hold up-right to drift rightwards, setting up a more obtuse angle for the wall-kick, which will let Mario turn more quickly. Press A to kick, then hover right after – how much later depends on how high up the wall the wall-kick hits, but optimally it's immediate. Tap C-left after the kick, to encourage Mario's turning. Drop the hover into a ledgegrab in the right spot.
* **GWKH**: HELP

The three wallkick setups cover different arrival times into the ledgegrab. We'll list them, then present each one. *Times are discussed using the in-game timer from practice codes, but there'll be an example of catching each cycle early and late, since you need to be able to tell from the windmill's position when doing runs without cheat codes.*
* **Right ledgegrab**: this is the easiest setup, and is fastest for its cycle. This can be done by dropping the ledgegrab in around the **29.20–34.50** window (earlier is possible but the wallkicks become risky). Non-advanced players would wait for this cycle if arriving early.
* **Left sideflip**: this is a backup setup for being too slow for right ledgegrab. It can be done by getting up from the ledge, then starting a sideflip in around the **32.00–39.50** window.
* **Y-turn wallkicks** [advanced]: the fastest possible left sideflip start is around [25.82](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/603942658), which is the same cycle as 40.83, just barely outside the left sideflip window. Instead of waiting for right ledgegrab, there's a setup that can be done at any arrival time; it's *slower* than right ledgegrab so shouldn't be done if you're on-time for that strat.

### Right Ledgegrab

**Fast – ledge-release at 29.32**

**Slow – ledge-release at 33.95**

* A good visual cue for where to ledgegrab is the [white area just right of centre](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/818324764296871936/unknown.png).
* To set up for the start visual cues, make sure to let the camera settle after the ledge-grab.
* If early, a visual cue for when to start is when Mario becomes fully occluded by the windmill. This means that the further right you are, the faster you'll start the kicks and the faster (by about the same amount) you'll enter the loading zone at the top. It starts to get risky after Mario's hand exits the [dark region he's holding in this picture](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/818324764296871936/unknown.png).
* If late, a visual cue for when to start is when Mario peeks out past the rightmost edge of the windmill blade.
* Press B to wallslide, then hold down, then long-press A (long-press = 5 frames or longer).
* Alternate between kicking with up-left and down-left left stick, long-pressing A each time, with two exceptions – kick 5/6 should be a short A-press (3f), and kick 6/6 should be up-right on the left stick.
* The further right you start the kicks, the more important it is to hit up-left/down-left, and likewise if you're further left, the kicks should be more up/down.
* It's safer but slower to go right on the final kick. You'll learn to adjust all of these angles and A-presses with experience.

### Left Sideflip

**Fast – sideflip at 32.12**

**Slow – sideflip at 39.36**

{% include yt.html id="nAI9FiYxmiI" %}

* A good visual cue for where to ledgegrab is the [white area just left of centre](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/818329953681932308/unknown.png).
* There are two ways of inputting the sideflip:
    * Press A to get up, hold down during the get-up, then time an A press to do a (buffered) sideflip. The window for the A press is 2 frames, and can be learnt by timing and visual feel.
    * Press L to centre the camera, A to get up, then hold up for a bit to walk forward about a Mario foot length. Now, at the right time, hold L, then hold down, then press A, each about 4 frames apart. This removes the 2-frame window but the turnaround animation can sometimes not come out for unknown reasons.
* Get a feel for when the window for the sideflip is from the above two examples.
* There are many viable kick patterns, since the 7.5s window allows for lots of windmill positions, but we'll go over one set that always works. Alternate between kicking up-left and down-left on left stick (i.e. outwards), long-pressing A each time except on kick 1/4, which is short. Then, hover around onto the roof.
* As with the right ledgegrab setup, hitting up/down on the left stick keeps Mario closer to the centre, and the same adjustment intuition also applies.

### Y-Turn Wall-Kicks
jpep halp pls u r only hope :(
