# Bianco 2

## Outline
Bianco 2 demands special attention when learning because it has the most complex decision-making of any level in the game. The basic idea is to get to the lake as fast as possible, to be able to handle any pattern the spider (pondskater) throws at you and bounce off it up to the windmill, and to then know which cycle to go for for windmill wallkicks.

## Beginner Strategy
Though it's tempting to crack this level on first visit since it's the 2nd shine in most full-game categories like Any% and 120 Shines, it's one of the most atypical and experience-heavy shines, so the biggest gains for a beginner are made by going for simplified strats and focusing on developing simple movement-oriented levels like Bianco 3 instead. As a beginner, go for:
* any **approach** to the pond;
* a simple linear strategy for getting the **spider**-bounce (see Spider section);
* ride the **windmill** platform.

Here's an example of a beginner run, to be commentated in the next few sections:
