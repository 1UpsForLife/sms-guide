# Bianco 2

## Outline
Bianco 2 demands special attention when learning because it has the most complex decision-making of any level in the game. The basic idea is to get to the lake as fast as possible, to be able to handle any pattern the spider (pondskater) throws at you and bounce off it up to the windmill, and to then know which cycle to go for for windmill wallkicks.

## Beginner Strategy
Though it's tempting to crack this level on first visit since it's the 2nd shine in most full-game categories like Any% and 120 Shines, it's one of the most atypical and experience-heavy shines, so the biggest gains for a beginner are made by going for simplified strats and focusing on developing simple movement-oriented levels like Bianco 3 instead. As a beginner, go for:
* any **approach** to the pond;
* a simple linear strategy for getting the **spider**-bounce (see Spider section);
* ride the **windmill** platform.

Here's an example of a beginner run, to be commentated in the next few sections:

## Approach
The standard strat for the approach is easy enough for all levels to learn, but in case you struggle, here are some notes for the [beginner example](https://youtu.be/8QYM2AlBIqg).

<details markdown="block"><summary>Beginner Approach Notes</summary>
* Practise the **initial hoverslide** method shown in the video. It may take a solid week to get down but it becomes natural and gets you into fast movement habits early.
* Practise the timing of the **buffered spin** (9:00 on IGT in the video) – another fundamental.
* Pressing A for longer makes **Mario rollout further** – holding for 5 frames gives max distance.
</details>

For the normal strat, it's important to go as fast as possible to get good cycles at the spider and windmill (the spider's usually still if you're on time). Notes:
* **Log triple-jump angle**: you're aiming to land around the back 1/4 of the log; to get a good angle, you could aim to hit [this corner of the path](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/817474117094998046/unknown.png). Grinding along the right edge loses about 2 frames.
* **Log triple-jump hover**: you can buffer the hover, meaning hold R before you go off the edge, and the hover comes out immediately. Hovering slows mario down, and in this case it's faster to not buffer the hover, to preserve speed and so get a faster double and triple-jump. It saves about 0.5s, but is also harder to time since Mario starts falling before hovering.
* **Wall dive/rollout**: aim for the corner of the wall, since that's closest, and turn left slightly right before diving and rolling-out off the wall. If you're too fast at the log triple-jump, it's easier and slower to aim slightly left, to hover longer and gain more height before the dive/rollout. You can slide thumb from B to A to get the rollout or press them normally. Hold A for as little as possible – we want a short rollout, minimal height gain, so we can waterslide earlier, since that is way faster than any rollout.
* **Second hoverslide**: the timing for this is the same as any hoverslide-out-of-spray – if it's causing you trouble, just run forward while spraying for a bit (holding up + R), then hoverslide in your own time.
* **Goop + sign dodge**: slide towards the edge of the goop (just right of the sign), then start holding up-left just after fully crossing the white path, to swerve away from the goop and get behind the sign. Straighten out right after passing the goop.

## Spider
We'll look at what we're aiming to do, what inputs we need to have down, and then go through a flowchart of reacting to the spider.

### Goals
* Jump off the spider close enough to the windmill to make it over there. This means in the back 3/4 or so on the pond (from the entry-point).
    * Dive onto the spider if possible (gives more speed on the jump).
    * Spin in midair if it looks like it might not make it (this decreases Mario's gravity in the *falling* half of the jump, so isn't that useful).
* The initial angle of the jump makes the biggest difference for speed and whether you'll make it, so we'll pay special attention to it. Loosely speaking, bear in mind the [imaginary line](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/817481323349671997/unknown.png) from the entry-point to the corner in the back wall, to orient yourself.
* The spider homes in on Mario whenever you land in the water, so we can use that to **bait** it if it's in a really bad location (it's a slow strategy).

That's all that we need to come up with a linear beginner strategy. Make sure to start practising the normal reaction-based strategy detailed below asap, though, since it's key to getting a good (first) windmill cycle.

<details markdown="block"><summary>Beginner Spider Notes</summary>
Spin-jump-dive off the shore after the waterslide to get close to the back wall, then try to immobilise the spider. You can wait for it to home in, then jump out and hover over it, or if it's in front of you, jump out and spam-spray while in the air. Try to then swim/hover around to get a good angle on it, then jump, hover (possibly backwards) to give yourself the right spacing, release hover and dive onto it.
</details>

### Inputs
There are a number of non-trivial inputs to practise that are used for different spiders.
* **Water jump-dive (WJD)**: *this is the fastest method for swimming in the game*. Mario can only jump out of the water when the left stick is neutral. As soon as you jump, hold forward and press B – sliding thumb from A to B in 1f is ideal. After landing, you can hit neutral again and repeat, but multiple swims are rarely needed in Bianco 2.
* **Water spam-spray (WSS)**: we can exploit the above mechanic to spam-spray without jumping out of the water – we just need to spam-spray while holding up. These are great for immobilising a spider that's coming towards you from in front.
* **Spam-spray dive (SSD)**: this is the same as the normal movement option for starting a waterslide from having the spray nozzle active (e.g. used in Ricco 5 and Gelato 1 to clear bloopers/cataquacks). Jump out of the water, hold digital R, then slide thumb from A to B.
* **Spam-spray hover (SSH)**: similarly to the above, jump out of the water, hold digital R, then slide thumb from A to X. The hover takes a few more frames to come out, so these inputs must be somewhat fast.

## Spider Flowchart
*Explained with a sample of 20 spider reactions from EquivocalGenius.*

At each jump, we'll react to where the spider is and pick a next move. At **step 1**, do **one or two jump-dive-rollouts along the shore**, to get closer to the spider without entering the water – one vs two depending on which brings you closest to it. This also buys us time to react to a spider that's not visible upon approaching the lake (since it's off to the left).

*Try to not enter the water by accident; if the spider is in the middle, baiting it brings it too close, so it'd have to be baited back, which would lose tons of time. You can grind along the wall while jumping/diving to take it safely, and won't bonk unless your angle is very aggressive.*

At **step 2**, we have three strategies, depending on where the spider is.

<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/529145099003887618/817602782227857438/unknown.png" width="400">

### Zone A: Rushdown
In this region, **spin-jump-dive straight towards the spider**. This is the fastest overall option.
* If the spider is really close to the windmill, bait it by landing from the rollout into the shallow water, then spin-jump-dive.
* If it's in a normal location within the zone, don't bait by jumping off the grass.

At **step 3**, we react to how far away the spider is from Mario's landing position.
* If the spider was baited, then it's coming at you; immobilise it with a **water spam-spray (WSS)**. <#12, #18>
* If the spider's at a medium distance, then approach + immobilse it with a **spam-spray dive (SSD)** – this move is slower but covers a large area with the spam-spray. <#1, #4, #11>
* If the spider's still far, then approach it with a **water jump-dive (WJD)**, baiting it in doing so, and immobilise with **WSS** upon landing. <#2>

To **finish**, you're close enough to the spider to jump and dive onto it. A short hover may be needed to adjust the angle, or distance if you fell short.

### Zone B: Containment
In this region, the spider is one of two things:
* too close to the left shore for a spin-jump-dive to approach it with space *(here, a spin-jump-dive may be unsafe since an accidental bait by rolling out into the water would pull it behind Mario)*;
* so far along the shore (2 jump-dive-rollouts) that it's about to skate off in a random direction as you approach it.

The move is to **spam-spray hover (SSH) straight from the shore** to immobilise the spider, then change direction midair to react to where it was starting to head to, and dive.

* In most cases with the spider far enough from the left shore, this move places Mario heading towards the spider with enough space to finish by jumping out, possibly hovering to adjust angle, then diving. <#3, #6, #13, #17, #19, #20>
* If the spider is too far away (it may not even have been immobilised by the spam-spray), landing baits it, and it can be finished in the manner of step 3 of rushdown, whereby you WSS, SSD, or jump-dive+WSS towards it depending on your distance from it after landing. <#8>
* *[advanced only]* If the spider is getting too close to the left shore – zone B/C – then it can take some fairly difficult improvisation to deal with it, in particular:
    * Diving straight onto the spider instead of into the water after the SSH. <#7, #14, #16>
    * Back-hovering and turning during the finishing move. <#5>

If you're not advanced (experienced with this level) and see a spider in the B/C zone after one jump-dive-rollout along the shore, do the bait strat (for zone C) instead.

### Zone C: Bait
In this region, we **give up on the spider's position and bait it into a good one**; this is very slow. In zone C, it's impossible to jump from the spider to the windmill, and in zone B/C, it's hard to adjust angle using the zone-B strat, so we opted for an easier option. After one jump-dive-rollout along the shore, at which point you've decided to bait the spider:
1. Spin-jump-dive directly towards the windmill (the bait starts upon landing).
2. WJD further towards the windmill.
3. Jump emptily out of the water while waiting for the spider to arrive.
4. Jump, hover backwards over the spider, and if you immobilise it, hover forward, adjust angle, and dive onto it.

## Windmill
The windmill turns one full circle in 60.06s *(it would've been 60s if the game ran at 30fps instead of 29.97s)*, meaning its cycles repeat every 15s. We'll look at 3 setups for windmill wallkicks.

The first step in each setup is to ledgegrab the windmill's alcove. Where exactly depends on the setup, but the methods are the same. Here are two:
* **Wall-kick hover**: when landing from the hover to the windmill, buffer a spin-jump, and release it after taking a step towards the left edge of the alcove. Once airborne, hold up-right to drift rightwards, setting up a more obtuse angle for the wall-kick, which will let Mario turn more quickly. Press A to kick, then hover right after – how much later depends on how high up the wall the wall-kick hits, but optimally it's immediate. Tap C-left after the kick, to encourage Mario's turning. Drop the hover into a ledgegrab in the right spot.
* **GWKH**: HELP

The three wallkick setups cover different arrival times into the ledgegrab. We'll list them, then present each one. *Times are discussed using the in-game timer from practice codes, but there'll be an example of catching each cycle early and late, since you need to be able to tell from the windmill's position when doing runs without cheat codes.*
* **Right ledgegrab**: this is the easiest setup, and is fastest for its cycle. This can be done by dropping the ledgegrab in around the **29.20–34.50** window (earlier is possible but the wallkicks become risky). Non-advanced players would wait for this cycle if arriving early.
* **Left sideflip**: this is a backup setup for being too slow for right ledgegrab. It can be done by getting up from the ledge, then starting a sideflip in around the **32.00–39.50** window.
* **Y-turn wallkicks** [advanced]: the fastest possible left sideflip start is around [25.82](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/603942658), which is the same cycle as 40.83, just barely outside the left sideflip window. Instead of waiting for right ledgegrab, there's a setup that can be done at any arrival time; it's *slower* than right ledgegrab so shouldn't be done if you're on-time for that strat.

### Right Ledgegrab

**Fast – ledge-release at 29.32**

{% include yt.html id="FEXMNGi0zsY" %}

**Slow – ledge-release at 33.95**

{% include yt.html id="6rWefa0lXn0" %}

* A good visual cue for where to ledgegrab is the [white area just right of centre](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/818324764296871936/unknown.png).
* To set up for the start visual cues, make sure to let the camera settle after the ledge-grab.
* If early, a visual cue for when to start is when Mario becomes fully occluded by the windmill. This means that the further right you are, the faster you'll start the kicks and the faster (by about the same amount) you'll enter the loading zone at the top. It starts to get risky after Mario's hand exits the [dark region he's holding in this picture](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/818324764296871936/unknown.png).
* If late, a visual cue for when to start is when Mario peeks out past the rightmost edge of the windmill blade.
* Press B to wallslide, then hold down, then long-press A (long-press = 5 frames or longer).
* Alternate between kicking with up-left and down-left left stick, long-pressing A each time, with two exceptions – kick 5/6 should be a short A-press (3f), and kick 6/6 should be up-right on the left stick.
* The further right you start the kicks, the more important it is to hit up-left/down-left, and likewise if you're further left, the kicks should be more up/down.
* It's safer but slower to go right on the final kick. You'll learn to adjust all of these angles and A-presses with experience.

### Left Sideflip

**Fast – sideflip at 32.12**

{% include yt.html id="SOIBWvX6PsI" %}

**Slow – sideflip at 39.36**

{% include yt.html id="nAI9FiYxmiI" %}

* A good visual cue for where to ledgegrab is the [white area just left of centre](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529145099003887618/818329953681932308/unknown.png).
* There are two ways of inputting the sideflip:
    * Press A to get up, hold down during the get-up, then time an A press to do a (buffered) sideflip. The window for the A press is 2 frames, and can be learnt by timing and visual feel.
    * Press L to centre the camera, A to get up, then hold up for a bit to walk forward about a Mario foot length. Now, at the right time, hold L, then hold down, then press A, each about 4 frames apart. This removes the 2-frame window but the turnaround animation can sometimes not come out for unknown reasons.
* Get a feel for when the window for the sideflip is from the above two examples.
* There are many viable kick patterns, since the 7.5s window allows for lots of windmill positions, but we'll go over one set that always works. Alternate between kicking up-left and down-left on left stick (i.e. outwards), long-pressing A each time except on kick 1/4, which is short. Then, hover around onto the roof.
* As with the right ledgegrab setup, hitting up/down on the left stick keeps Mario closer to the centre, and the same adjustment intuition also applies.

jpep halp pls u r only hope :(
