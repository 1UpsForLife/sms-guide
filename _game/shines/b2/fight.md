## Baiting Petey to Open His Mouth

Knowing how to cause Petey to open his mouth is important for success in the fight. In order to trigger this reliably, you must stand to the side of him.

You want to stand as close to the right as possible in order to reduce the amount of time Petey takes to turn, but not too much to the right or Petey will swing his head. You want to line up Mario's legs on both sides of the dark green line on Petey's hand before he rises back up for the optimal positioning.

For this first hit, this is made more difficult since you need to clean the ground first, and get near the spot. There's an alternative visual cue that you can use to line Mario up. These 4 white bricks near Petey can be useful for lining you up properly. Look for the bottom corner closest to Petey for the optimal turn.

## Petey Spam Sprays

There are two different methods for quickly filling Petey with water.

### Y-Cam Method

Simply Y-Cam, then spray, then spam spray after to finish filling. This is slower, but can be more consistent for some players.

### Backflip Method

It takes 2 full spam sprays to fill Petey's mouth (go for 3 to be safe in case you partially miss). If you're having trouble, focusing on having two properly timed spam sprays can help you become more consistent with the timing.

Start your backflip when Petey is almost finished turning, so that you are near the top of his head as he opens it to maximize your window for spam sprays.

## Shine Grab

After the third ground pound, you will want to orient yourself so you're facing towards the two vines hanging down from the ceiling. Towards the middle of the screen, you'll notice another 4 white brick pattern in an L shape. Standing near it, on this brick, puts you in the perfect position for the shine.

If you have perfect spam sprays, Petey will always disintegrate in the same spot. Look for this goop particle to vanish before you double jump hover to touch the lowest possible spot. See this image for proper positioning.
