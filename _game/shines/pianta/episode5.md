# Pianta 5
Pianta 5 is made up of two parts: the Entry and the Secret.

## Entry

## Secret
- Upon entry, dive rollout then perform two jump dive rollouts to talk to the first Chuckster.

### Early Cycle
The final chuckster can stop at one of 6 nodes on the upper platform. These are shown below:

The chuckster starts at position 1 and walks counter-clockwise continuously through the six nodes. When the chuckster begins his walking phase, a timer is set to a random value between 2.5 and 25 seconds. When this timer finishes, the chuckster will continue walking until he reaches the next node and then stop. Once the chuckster stops, he will wait for a random amount of time between 0.833 and 10 seconds. Then he will begin his walking phase again, and the process repeats continuously.

To attain early cycle, you must talk to the final chuckster before he reaches the spot above. With nearly perfect execution, it is theoretically possible to achieve this without the final chuckster stopping at all. An example of this is shown [here.](https://i.imgur.com/8AOMuMy.mp4) This requires talking to the 2nd chuckster immediately, which can be done regardless of which direction the chuckster is facing on NTSC-U and NTSC-J because of their longer textboxes. However, due to PAL's short textboxes, the chuckster must be facing towards Mario, otherwise talking to the chuckster from behind will cause him to throw Mario an unintended direction.
#### Chuckster Manipulation
A thorough explanation of chuckster manipulation can be seen here:

The easiest way to attain early cycle is if he stops at node 2 and/or 3. The longer he stops, the more likely it is to attain early cycle. Without chuckster manipulation, the probability of him stopping at least once is 43.56%. However, some chuckster manipulation is inherently incurred by talking to the first three chucksters, which increases the probability of the final chuckster stopping at least once.
#### Rat Bounce
Demonstrated in the video below, rat bouncing can be an effective technique if early cycle is not achieved. Rat bouncing is simply bouncing on the chuckster right before they reach a node where they can stop. This resets their walking timer which ensures that they don't stop at the node directly in front of them because it takes less than the minimum 2.5 seconds to reach that node. In addition, they are unlikely to stop at the following node as well, so it is not recommended to rat bounce at two nodes in a row. A common example of what would be recommended if early cycle is missed is to rat bounce just before Node 4, let the chuckster walk through Node 5, then rat bounce again just before Node 6. There is roughly a 17% chance of the chuckster stopping at Node 5 after stopping at Node 4. If he stops, let him walk through Node 6.
