# EYG
This is a strat where we access the Yoshi-Go-Round early, and skip Pinna Park episode 5.  
Pinna Park episode 4 is required to be completed to unlock Yoshi for this strategy.  
Due to the difficulty of this strategy, its usually recommended to just do Pinna Park episode 5 
and episode 6 as intended until you reach a low 1:2x time (Any% no ACE) as it only saves a little over a minute.

*2-Stu is generally considered outdated, but some people find it easier. Feel free to experiment!*

## Intermediate  
*Both of these tutorials are for **PAL/NTSC-U**, where you do fruit storage instead of throwing the fruit past the park loading zone in **JP***

##  Advanced  
*Top level players do 1-Stu but only have it do 1 pound, saving some time. The timing is tight on this strat and no tutorials exist as of this moment.*
