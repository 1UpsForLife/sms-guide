# Ricco 3
Ricco 3 has a surprising RNG element: how quickly the crane moves. This can change the best way to approach the ending of the level.
## Beginner - Spin Jump
{% include yt.html id="4OqNmNgyDyw" %}

- Jump then dive, dive hop, and rollout while adjusting your position to the right
- Spin jump dive to the edge of the boat, fall off, then spin jump dive onto the upper section
- Rollout, then spin jump and hover towards the crane
- Depending on crane position, you can hover to the arm of the crane and dive onto it and slide off then hover
- If the crane position is not favorable, spin jump and hover to the center of the crane. Then jump and spin towards the crane and hover when beneath it
- Continue hovering until Mario hangs from the cage. Climb towards the gate, flip it, then jump dive into the shine

## Advanced - Front Beyblade
{% include yt.html id="cdAG3eJmUu8" %}

- Perform the same entry movement as the beginner strat, but spin jump up to the upper section instead of spin jump dive
- Beyblade off the sloped orange part of the boat, aiming towards the cage's gate
- Hover, then either jump or spin jump off the crane depending on its position
- Finish the level the same as the beginner strat

## Advanced - Back Beyblade
This strat can be up to 0.7s faster than front beyblade and nearly 2s faster than beginner strat.
{% include yt.html id="c1ia2Hx-fzg" %}

- If the crane is not in a favorable position, you may need to aim towards the center of the crane instead
- Hover then either jump or spinjump off the crane depending on its position
- Finish the level the same as the beginner strat
