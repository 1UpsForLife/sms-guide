# How to create a gameplay comparison video


kdenlive free editor (https://kdenlive.org/en/download/ , click Windows install version).  
how to make comparison: https://i.imgur.com/78wbSI9.png  
import your clips with the button under "project bin" on the top left  
drag them on timeline  
add Edge Crop effect and Transform (resize and position vid) effect to each clip.  
make sure both vids are the same size (use the size percentage field) and then position it by changing the X and Y fields.  
you can type in values or scroll to make finer adjustment  
you can save your values for these effects by clicking one of the little settings menus in the bar with the effect name. so next time you make a comparison you'll be able to apply the same effects.  
render button on top when u are done, most likely you want to choose mp4 format and full project option. parallel processing will make the vid render faster but if u see glitches in final vid then try turning it off.  
  
warning: do not "switch to clip profile" like it says on left because youre putting 2 clips in the same vid so you're making them smaller and the quality would be lower if u switched, so dont do that  
warning 2: vids may look laggy when playing them back in the editor, that's because it's applying the effects realtime and playing them back to you. it wont actually look like that after it's rendered (unless your source clips are messed up ofc)
