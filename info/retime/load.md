# Load Retime

Loads that weren't timed using loadless shine-get timer (meaning they were timed in real-time, either from video or pre-2020 SGT) should be retimed. The level is split into the load and the parts before + after, the latter of which are timed with the usual methods for those segments. The load is assigned a constant pessimistic estimate based on an empirical sample.

For full-level secrets, this constant is **0.60** – see the [sample of past loads](https://tiny.cc/smsilretiming). Other kinds of loads haven't been looked into yet.
