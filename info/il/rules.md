# IL Rules
These rules apply the main tab, **ILs**; other tabs loosely abide by these but are informal have some deviations. Check example videos from the sheet you're interested in, and ask in the Discord's #help channel if still unclear.

Rules are non-italicised and *guidelines (on best practices) are italicised*.

1. **Platform rules**: ILs may be run on console (Nintendont or Swiss), or emulator. They must be run:
    1. **On 60Hz** (if you are on PAL, ensure 60Hz is enabled by holding B during startup with intro skip practice code off; NTSC is always 60Hz).
    2. **Never using save-states to reset** (use the level select practice code and e.g. exit area).

2. **Permitted practice codes**: all codes are generally allowed, but some levels have specific restrictions **posted in the note on the level's name**. Specific rules:
    1. **Free Pause** is allowed but midair pausing is banned.
    2. **Fast Text (DPad Functions)** is allowed except for Pianta 5 Full and Secret.
    3. **Remove Saveboxes** is allowed except for Airstrip.
    4. **Any Fruit Opens Yoshi Eggs** is always allowed.
    5. **FMV Skips** is allowed but skipping cutscenes in the normal way by pressing a button (i.e. not exit area) is banned specifically in Pinna 1.
    6. **Position Store/Load (DPad Functions)** is allowed specifically outside the part of the level being timed – usually to set up a starting position.
    7. **Fix Manta Splitting** is required for Sirena 1.

3. **Timer**: all times must be **obtained directly from the in-game timer** provided by the **Shine Get Timer** practice code, version 2 or later (from Oct 2019), *except* for any times that are retimed (as below).
    1. Retimes may be requested by posting a video somewhere in the main Discord. The video must be somewhat cropped (i.e. <5 mins long). Examples of common retime situations are ILs from full-game runs or done without fast text by accident.
    2. Retimes are available for all levels except those where accurate load timing hasn't been done by the community, namely `Bianco 2, Ricco 1; Pinna 1,8; Noki 3,4,8; Airstrip, Corona Mountain (Full)`.

4. **Video requirement**: video proof is:
    1. **Required for top-3 times**. Top-3 times submitted without video after 2021/06/09 will be deleted.
    2. ***Highly encouraged for every IL**. Videos legitimise your runs, show respect for the competition, and provide documentation/ideas for all to learn from, at all skill-levels/parts of the leaderboard. To these ends, you're expected to contribute more videos the higher you rank. Guideline (% of videos per total entries, relative to total points ranking): 15% for top 50, 30% for top 30, 50% for top 15, 70% for top 5.*
    3. Required for specific setup-intensive levels, namely `Sirena 2 Reds Setup` and any hyper-hover IL (see rule #6).

5. **Video validity criteria:** every link must be to a valid video, "valid" meaning: 
    1. The video **must include the entire gameplay** of the run (i.e. every input), and **should include the entire run** (i.e. while the timer is running, including the whole intro cutscene). Videos missing timed non-gameplay might be removed (per mod discretion).
    2. *The video ideally includes everything from the input that reset the level (and the ensuing load) to at least 2 seconds after the timer stops at the end.*
    3. The time shown on the in-game timer in, or logged in the [retime sheet](https://tiny.cc/smsilretimelog) for, the video **matches the time reported on the sheet** to within 0.02, i.e. less than a frame.
    4. The video is of **sufficient quality and without major frame-drops** (per mod discretion).
    5. *Game audio should be present (though it needn't be the only audio).*
    6. *If you want to link something that isn't a valid video, you may put it in a note – e.g. a link to a video of a worse time. You may choose between reporting a worse time with link or a better one without – a choice between more points or a medal maybe – but it's nice to still keep the other time/video in a note.*

6. **Hyper-hover glitch**: ILs using the [hyper-hover glitch](https://clips.twitch.tv/StylishShakingTubersOSkomodo-5KdV2BXaPwASFPMF) **have stricter proof requirements** to ensure the setup is replicable by a verifier or future runner.
    1. For every **new setup**, the first submission needs to provide (1) a save-file to start from, (2) a video of the setup, and (3) a text note (on the sheet or video) explaining the setup.
    2. Future submissions on an **existing setup** only need a video of the run itself and note mentioning which setup was used.
