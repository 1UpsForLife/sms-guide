## ILs!
[IL Spreadsheet](https://sunmar.io/il){: .btn }

SMS has leaderboards on this spreadsheet for various individual level–based categories, for practice, competition and analysis. The full spreadsheet comprises tabs for
* **ILs** – mostly-unrestricted ILs. The challenge of optimising a single level as much as possible co-exists with practice for Any% and other blue-coin-less categories.
* **120 ILs** – ILs with blue-coin requirements, for 120-Shine segment practice.
* **RTA Strat ILs** – ILs on different strats to optimise and compare them. A kind of living documentation that gives an overview of how fast different things are.
* **Bingo ILs** – misc. ILs, motivated by bingo, that are practice for bingo goals, category extensions, or just arbitrary tasks.
* **Best Splits/Segments** – for documenting your best times as achieved in Any% or 120 Shines runs.

Make sure to check the front page and notes on category titles for rules. If that's unclear then some example videos could help, or just asking in the Discord's #help channel.

### Should I Do ILs?
If you want to! Do them if you're naturally interested and motivated. But for a more strategic answer, check out [this essay](il-essay) I wrote.

### Setting Up
[Practice Codes](https://gct.zint.ch){: .btn }

ILs in SMS are based around the infrastructure of these cheat codes. This makes them accessible to every Wii and PC Dolphin emulator setup, but rarely any GameCube. Homebrew is required for Wii/GameCube. Timing is done via a hacked in-game timer, and selecting and resetting levels is done via button combinations.

[Practice Codes Guide](https://gct.zint.ch/guide.html){: .btn }

Here's the installation guide. Please make sure to follow it exactly – particularly when it recommends something, you should see it as *mandatory* unless you know what you're doing. In particular, check that **your Homebrew installation did everything mentioned in the [linked guide](https://wii.guide)** and that **you have the [latest version of Nintendont](https://share.zint.ch/nintendont/latest/Nintendont.zip) installed**.

ILs in SMS are less accessible in (mostly) requiring cheat codes and hacked Wiis but this is necessary practically. Having to retime every IL from video is an unmanageable amount of work that sets back the accessibility of doing ILs far more. Having fast  resets is also a substantial buff to how much they can get optimised, and like the previous point, how enjoyable and healthy they are to play, learn with and compete in.

## Submission Guide
### Formatting
Make sure your time is formatted as `4.51` or `16.30` or `1:39.22`. This is different to what the timer looks like in-game – there's a `.` between the seconds and centiseconds, and a `:` after the minutes if required. 1dp (e.g. `16.3`) is accepted for now but I wouldn't bet on it being accepted in future. Check back in 5 mins on any times you've typed in; if they are highlighted red then the formatting needs to be fixed. Misformatted times don't count for points.

### Video?
The top time for a level is highlighted and in future, top 3 will be too. Highlighted times are required to have video. It's otherwise optional, but very encouraged. Let me explain why...

The cost of recording an IL video for someone who's able to record an Any% run is very small. See [this section](video-tools.md#recording-short-videos) to judge for yourself. The benefit is that you contribute to a collection of videos that can be used by everyone to learn strats, time strats, and get a feel for what level of play corresponds to what times. Videos also legitimise your runs, particularly when they rank highly for a specific level or you've reached a high overall level in points ranking.

YouTube videos are preferred, though Twitch clips are fine if that's simpler for you. Twitter is allowed but discouraged. This is all owing to how easy it is to frame-advance and download videos, as well as Twitter's uncontrollable viewer-side hyper-compression.

### Links
Hyperlinks are used to link videos for IL submissions. The time you achieve in the video must match the time you put in your cell (max 0.02 of leeway is allowed). To provide evidence that doesn't meet this standard, you can use notes. For example, if you have an unrecorded PB, you may decide to either a) type it in, unlink it and put the old time + link in a note, or b) keep the old time + link and put the new time in a note. Any other supporting evidence like pictures of times can go in notes as well.

Please also ensure the whole IL is present in the video (i.e. all gameplay), and that there aren't serious frame-drops. Then the video won't be at risk of failing standards in the future.

### Notes
Adding notes is a convenient way of commenting on your submissions in a way that's immediately apparent to people browsing the sheet. Right-click a cell and select **Insert Note**. Don't use comments; these aren't protected from being removed by anyone, and will be phased out of the sheet in future.

### IGT and Retiming
By default, all stated times for ILs must match the time shown in-game with the shine-get timer cheat code. However, you're allowed to submit times without the timer, e.g. from a full-game run, to be retimed by a mod; just post them somewhere in the Discord. Such submissions must be accompanied by a *cropped* (not timestamped) video, for ease of verification. If you're interested in learning how to retime your own videos, see [here](retime.md). The times are adjusted for loads and text.
