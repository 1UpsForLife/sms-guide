## About GitHub/Markdown

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/pyorot/sms-guide/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
This is a syntax-highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](url)
```

One newline doesn't do anything; two give a paragraph break. For an ordinary line break, append two spaces to the end of the line.  
*Like this.*

You can manually indent text using the special *en space* character, which you can copy from this example:  
    *This line is indented by 4 en-spaces.*

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pyorot/sms-guide/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
